# Recap

Grol, the Bugbear leader of the Cragmaw Tribe was holding your friend Gundren hostage, but You infiltrated their castle, grabbed Gundren, and found the map to Wave Echo Cave, then escaped from the horde of hobgoblins and goblins that pursued you by fleeing through the woods at breakneck speed.

While you had lost your immediate pursuit in the forest, the group of goblins had no trouble following you all the way back to your town. "Sally" and Garlyle were able to scout behind you and gave you word of the approaching band, giving you time to set up defenses. With Gundren and Sildar at your side, you managed to defend from a two-pronged assault on the town at night, with Ragnar and Sildar holding their own in front of the Stonehill Inn.

Upon reuniting with Gundren, he promised rewards if you were to get him safely back to Phandalin: a promise to put in a good word for RedWing to get some heavy armor, A 10% share of the mine proceeds to split amongst the group, and an additional 5% (15% total) if you guys cleared out the mines, also promised 25sp each upon reaching Phandalin.

DREAMS:

Gunther:

- Same dream as RedWing. #1

Beldroth:

- X You awaken with visions of a finely dressed red-skinned figure, a rapier sheethed at his side. The figure nods at you, and you see a smile curling at the edge of his face. A feeling of freezing cold overwealms you, You awaken in a cold sweat, your clothes oddly stiff as though frozen
- X Dream about his patron, Levistus: In the middle of the night, you eyes open wide, as if they were pried open by two strong hands. Your entire body goes stiff, frozen in place. A cold creeps over you starting from your extremities and working its way in, until it reaches your heart which beats... slower... and stops. Rather than bringing death, your mind flashes with life, and in the next instant there is a finely dressed red-skinned figure standing above you, arms crossed, while his chin rests in one hand contemplatively. He speaks to you calmly, in a rich baritone voice, "Your path to power will take you under Farun, and what you seek is even now being sought by others. Forge yourself into a weapon worthy of the abilities I grant you." His finger reaches for your forehead, "And. Do. Not Fail Me.", Your body can do nothing to resist as his cold touch caresses your forehead. He disappears, leaving you suddenly able to move. You look around to see the night still thick upon you.

Dream commanding him to wield the Forge of Spells: The aches and pains of the arduous day wear on you, but you begin to fall asleep. A mote of green light appears above your head, floating gently. You reach out to grab it, unable to tell if you are yet asleep or not. With a flash, the mote bursts into a bright green flame. Your arm reaches out as if driven by lightning to grasp the fire. The moment your hand closes, the flame becomes a rapier that hums with magical energy. An icy voice whispers in your ear, "Your path lies through the Forge. Avail yourself of it, and I will guide you." (this grants Beldroth advantage on his Arcana check to determine how the Forge of Spells work)

Ragnar:

RedWing:

- X #1 You close your eyes, and a darkness comes upon you, deeper than just sleep. In the stillness, you hear only your breathing, and a distant conversation echoing towards you as if from a cave or from the bottom of a well, though only one conversant seems to make it to your ears, "Your slow progress pains me, Nezzar... Can do what you will with it, after I have outfitted the army... Stake your claim as if you were some lazy Dwarven prospector? ... Disappoint me and it will be /your/ head floating around that mine!", The echoes die down, and it's only upon awakening that you think it could have been more than just a dream.
- As your eyes close in sleep, the same intrusive voice that came to you in nights past appears again. Its sinister undertone leaves you feeling queasy, yet you strain your ears to listen, though the voice appears to be from inside your head: "You are losing your grip on the situation… Is this such a hard task for someone who calls himself the "Black Spider"? If you have so many eyes, why has the map slipped through your fingers? If you have so many legs, why have you not taken the Forge?

Long Rest:

- Dreams

- Dark Elf (The Spider) dreams (to non-elves)

- My flaw is a deep fear of my estranged half brother, Theren, who is a Dark Elf. Theren haunts the dreams of non-Elven players (because Elves don't sleep) in an attempt to locate and capture me, and bring me to the dark world.

- Warlock's pact: patron of vengeance, Levistus. Mother was an elf, father human. he's half-elf, with plans for vengeance against elves (Zenon, Leshanna). Describe Levistus

- """You fall asleep easily enough, tired from the combination of your injuries and exertion of the day. """
- X You awaken with visions of a finely dressed red-skinned figure, a rapier sheathed at his side. The figure nods at you, and you see a smile curling at the edge of his face. A feeling of freezing cold overwhelms you, You awaken in a cold sweat, your clothes oddly stiff as though frozen
- silken clothing and carried a shining rapier,[[4]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Levistus#cite_note-BoVD-pp154-155.165-4) now donning fanciful garments and other finery when meeting mortals in projected form.[[10]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Levistus#cite_note-Dragon-223-pp16-10) When appearing as an aspect, the air around him was chilling and his clothes were always partially frozen and dripping with water.
- His followers, known as bladereavers, hardly matched the image of sinister cultists, solemn priests or zealous fanatics, instead wielding rapiers and wearing flamboyant outfits more commonly seen on daring swashbucklers
